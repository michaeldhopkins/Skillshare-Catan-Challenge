One Wednesday evening, you arrive at Skillshare HQ to take a class from your favorite teacher. Before you make it to class, though, you are kidnapped! Your captors immediately blindfold you and lock you in a room by yourself.

As they walk out the door, they hand you a stack of cards. Baffled, and with your blindfold still tightly on, you ask what the cards are for and why you have been kidnapped.

One of the captors responds, “We have handed you a regular deck of 52 playing cards. Within the deck, there are exactly 16 cards that have been turned face up. If you want to be released and make it to your class on time, you must split the 52 cards into 2 decks. Both decks must have the same number of face-up cards. You must keep the blindfold on, and can not damage the cards in any way.”

The class is about to start in 15 minutes. What do you do?

Answer: you do what this Javascript does, but with cards and your hands.
